# Graph Traversal with DFS and BFS in C++

## Overview
This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms for graph traversal. The project demonstrates how to apply these classic algorithms to find optimal paths in a graph structure.

## Features
- **DFS Implementation**: A recursive approach to traverse the graph deeply before exploring neighbors.
- **BFS Implementation**: A queue-based approach to explore the graph level by level.
- **Optimal Traversal**: Both algorithms are optimized for efficient graph traversal.
